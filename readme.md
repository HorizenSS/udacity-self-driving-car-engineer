## Projecs

### Basic Lane Line Detection
Find lane markings in images and video using region of interest selection, grayscaling, Gaussian smoothing, Canny Edge Detection and Hough Transform line detection.

### Advanced Lane Line Detection
Find lane markings in images and video using color transformations, gradients, and perspective transformation. Determine the curvature of the lane and the vehicle position with respect to center.

### Traffic sign classifier
Train and validate a model to classify traffic sign images using the German Traffic Sign Dataset.

### Behavioral Cloning
Use Udacity's driving simulator to create a dataset to clone driving behavior by training and validating a model using Keras. The model outputs a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.
